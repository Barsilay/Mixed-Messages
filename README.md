# Welcome to my Mixed-Messages Personal Practice Project!
## Description:
This project was intended to reinforce my knowledge of Github, Git, version control, and a few concepts on coding. Even though there is still much that can be done, I used this project as a base for future use. Being able to create separate files, stage them for committing, commit them, and then merge the branches together helped me take a step closer to becoming a full-stack engineer.
I only hope this project is relatively easy to follow, and I hope it could show my current skills and where I can be!

## How to Use:
If this repository were to be cloned, only change the quotes within the array found in the "java.js" file. This would allow you to click on the button and display any message desired.

## Conclusion: 
This project is simple, but I hope anyone looking at this can see what it means to start from the bottom!
